//following is the basic structure of all c++ code 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    //program code
}

/*
 * The #include is used to imports all the necessay libraries that have inbuilt functions .
 1. <iostream> - for user IO 
 2. <math.h> - for math operations
 3. <string> - for using strings 
 4. <bits/stdc++.h> - to inculde most of the standared c++ libraries

 * namespace in C++ is like a container that allows us to group related functions , classes and objects under a unique name. It helps avoid name conflicts in large projects where multiple libraries or modules might define function or variables in the same name
 std namespace:
     - The std namespace encloses all the standard library components.
     - "using namespace std;" is used here to simplify code by allowing direct access 
       to these components without needing to prefix them with "std::".
